Lab 2: Simple Data Path

-----------
DESCRIPTION

In this lab, a user is required to input a number from a keypad (4-Bit Binary) and perform a bitwise left rotation. The program also uses a total of 4 register keypads that can store 
certain values from the keyboard output, which eventually is transferred to ALU input 1 and ALU input 2 using logic. The main computation is performed in the final ALU circuit which performs
the bitwise left rotation. Additionally, the store select stores the ALU output to be restated into the circuit.
