Summary: In this lab, we learned how to completely focus all of our material that we have learned over the quarter and combine it in a physical game based program known as BattleBoats. By using the libraries that were given, we are asked to create a list of files that combine to create a fully functional battleboats game using physical buttons with the OLED display.

Approach: The approach I took for this lab was definitely different compare to most labs that I have done in the past. Many of the labs in the past were mostly focusing on one file at a time, and finishing each one and moving onto the next. In this lab, I had to realize that I cannot do that, and that I had to really debug and test each function that I write that goes across multiple files. Not only did I have to worry about if one of the files worked, I had to also create test cases for each of the files that we needed to code. My general approach was finishing each file slowly with the test cases instead of finishing each file individually by itself.

Results: I definitely think that if I had more time for this lab, I would've been able to enjoy coding it as well as been able to complete Field.c. I was annoyed that a lot of my code wasn't working at first, and I wasn't able to test some certain issues because of how I didn't have the files I needed to complete the whole battleboats program. In addition to not having time, I was hit with the flu and had a fever for around 2 days out of the week that we are given. I also didn't understand why we didn't have the last week to complete the lab, as we don't have a final in this class. I definitely would've enjoyed coding the lab more with the extra extension until finals week. Overall, this quarter has been a very good learning experience in terms of coding in the C language and getting to use the PICKIT.
