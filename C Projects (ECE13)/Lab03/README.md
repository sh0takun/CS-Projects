In this lab, we learned how to write different useful functions to print matrices, and run the provided operations. There are also two files that needed to be completed for the lab which is the test file, and the actual MatrixMath.c file. The important aspect of this lab is to test whether your functions in MatrixMath work by called MatrixEquals, and including a global counter to find the finished percentage of the functions.

I took a very direct approach of filling out the functions on the MatrixMath file, and later testing the codes after filling out the functions. I think the smart play was to code the function, and immediately test it out after as the memory is fresh in your brain of how you coded the function. If I were to approach this lab differently, I would have spent more time on Inverse, as that is something that I did not get to complete.

I ended up spending over 2 days on this lab, and I liked how I got to learn whether my function I wrote was right. One thing that I would've liked was more time on my assignment. Without the pressure and stress, I think I would've finished my last function, inverse.
