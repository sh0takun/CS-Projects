Summary: In this lab, we learned how to connect our PICkit3 with our C programming files and writing basic code for the buttons, switches, OLED display, Potentiometer, etc. We wrote code on MPLABX, and tested our file with necessary header files and source files. 

Approach: For this lab I pretty much first read the entire lab, taking notes and writing pseudocode for every file that was required for the lab. Because I didn't do the extra credit assignment for the first lab I believe where you had to practice using the OLED display for "hello world", I had to spend a couple hours of studying and reading the PIC32. After writing the pseudocode and studying the PIC32, I started off with button_timers as stated in the lab document, and ended with bounce_buttons. After writing code for each file, I was able to test the files individually using DEBUG function. 

Final Section: I actually completed every single segment of this lab which was suprising. I spent a decent amount of time doing this lab in general as I didn't get a high score on my 3rd lab. I really liked interacting with the PIC32 and the actual hardware and testing it. I am very excited to use the board for the next lab, as it is really satisfying seeing your code physically work on the board. What I disliked was that there were not that much resources in terms of setting up and testing files as well as connecting the PIC32 to the computer. Because I had a Mac, it was a different process. Overall I really enjoyed doing this lab.
