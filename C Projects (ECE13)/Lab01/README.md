Thoughts on lab/mistakes:
In this lab, you are required to introduce yourself to setting up new projects on MPLABX, how to operate and use the UNO32, and learning basic C printf syntax.
Specifically, I learned how to display print statements with different precisions and widths of characters. In addition, I learned how to replace words, use diff, and
other basic implementations on MPLABX for future assignments. I had a hard time in part 2, specifically finding how to limit widths and different precisions of numbers.
I really liked this lab, and I am excited for future labs.
