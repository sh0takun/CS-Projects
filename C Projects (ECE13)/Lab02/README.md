What happens if the line “scanf(" ");” executes? Why?
Nothing happens, because there's no input value.

In this lab, we forbid you from using printf() or scanf() inside of certain functions. Explain why a rule like this is useful.
You don't use printf or scanf in calculation functions because those functions are only used to return the value after completing what they need to complete. For example, 
you would not call a calculation function to print something. You call that function to do the math, which is addition. They should only return the value that is necessary
to be printed as the output on your main code that class the function.

How long did this lab take you? Was it harder or easier than you expected?
This lab took me around 2 days to complete. It was a little hard, but with resources it was easy to complete.
