Summary: In this lab, we learned how to create stack functions that are implemented inside of a Reverse Polish Notation calculator. Using these stack functions, we were asked to create a main file that calls for RPN functions in rpn.c. Reverse Polish Notation is a depiction of writing down equations without the need for parentheses. (Ex: 3+5 would be 3 5 +). Knowing how to use Reverse Polish Notation, I learned numerous ways how to use it in our project. By using new commands such as strtok, fgets, and pointers, this lab became easier to understand. In addition, Reverse Polish Notation is easy to program using a very simple stack data structure. 

My Approach: First, I decided that I would start off with the stack file, as that is the file that would be called in my rpn.c file. Understanding how the Reverse Polish Notation works, I was able to understand how to empty and clear stacks in relation to RPN. By coding the rpn file using my stack function, I was able to connect that to my main function. Then finally, the number will be returned from my rpn file to the main file and shown as a result.



Final Results: The only function that I wasn't able to finish was ProcessBackspaces. The reason why I didn't finish this function was mainly I ran out of time and I read that the function was only worth one point. I also didn't have time to code stack_test and rpn_test. I was very busy the past week with taking care of my grandparents which made it really hard for me to multitask with other classes while traveling and completely finishing the lab. Even though I didn't get to test my function, I thought that coding Eval function was pretty straightforward. I first created a helper function to check for floats, and then using the helper function I was able to code the actual calculator itself while pushing and popping the stack.
