Summary: In this lab, we learned file input and output functions while producing a role playing game. The basic concept of the lab was to create a game that moves through different rooms, while reading the input and output. By allowing the user to make a move through North, East, South, and West, we are able to code a playable role playing game.

Approach: My approach to this lab was to not start off with just one specific file, but work with multiple files at once. By allowing myself to work on different files, I was able to call functions from the different files that I start to code. I ultimately finished the main file, then the player file, and then I worked on the game file. I had to read and watch a bunch of videos on c programming file input and output, as I didn't have much experience.

Results: I was able to completely finish this lab, but I definitely struggled with being able to understand the different functions that are needed to use for file input/output. I really like the general concept of a role playing game, as I have never really coded my own role playing game before. I definitely enjoyed doing this lab more compared to the past few labs as we did. It was definitely a breather from working with the PICKIT, as this lab can solely be performed using gcc.
