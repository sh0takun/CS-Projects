InsertionSort Time: 36.104ms

InsertionSort vs Selection Sort: InsertionSort is better because it traverses through only what it needs to traverse to place the last sorted element versus SelectionSort which goes through the whole list every single time it tries to place an element. 

Summary: In this lab we were required to code LinkedList with different functions to sort a list that is given. My first approach to the lab was to start off with the LinkedList file and test each function in the LinkedListTest file. By doing this, I was able to debug and see what was wrong with my main file. By finishing all of the functions in LinkedList, I was able to start on my sort file. By looking at the pseudocode, I was able to complete sort pretty quick. I really liked how the pseudocode was provided for Insertion and Selection Sort. 


Results: I completely finished this lab compared to the other lab that I did last week. I made time to work on this lab throughout the week, comparing my LinkedList file with the LinkedListTest file. I am proud of finishing this lab, and I am excited to start the next. Even though this lab took a lot of time, it was fun to do.
